Each variable has a **.Bild** rule. Use the **ImgtoTextassistant.exe** file to digitize the desired image. You can put comments that are easy to remember for the image you have digitized, **copy all the content after the Text:= phrase into that variable**. The program will work by recognizing that image and clicking on it according to complex algorithms.\r\n- with each variable having the value 0,0. Use **Window Spy** to get the corresponding Mouse position value, then copy and paste the 2 X,Y values ??separated by \", \".\r\n- with each variable having the value 0, 0, 0, 0. Use **ImgtoTextassistant.exe**, then go to the **\"get range\"** option and select the desired range.\r\n- The program does not have a non-prestige option yet, so if you want to do that, leave the \" Perk.Bild \" value blank.\r\n- Pay attention to how weight affects your character's mobility and **watch your first run carefully** to catch errors early.\r\n- COMPLETELY **TURN OFF VIETNAMESE TYPING PROGRAMS** OR OTHER TYPING PROGRAMS, CHANGE TO **ENGLISH (US)** TO ENSURE THE MACRO DOES NOT HAVE KEY SENDING ERROR.\r\n-  **Do not update** if the macro is running smoothly or you do not need to add new features or there is no request from the author.\r\n\r\n### **Important Note**\r\n\r\n- This update is **completely incompatible** with any previous updates, so **do not put them in the same folder** or delete the old version if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Thanks to those who supported and tried the product to help make it better**"}
